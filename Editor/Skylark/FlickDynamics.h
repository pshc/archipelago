//
//  This code mimics the scroll/flick dynamics of the iPhone UIScrollView.
//  What's cool about this code is that it is entirely independent of any iPhone
//  UI, so you can use it to provide scroll/flick behavior on your custom views.
//
//  The key thing (which you'll learn fast if you try and build this yourself) is that
//  you can't just rely on the last two points to compute your motion vector. Instead
//  you need to "look back in time" to figure out where the touch was, say, 0.07 seconds
//  ago. That will give you a much better sense of your vector and speed.
//
//  In order to answer the question "where was the touch 0.07 seconds ago" we keep a 
//  history of the last N touches. When the user's touch is released, we look back through
//  the history and use linear interpolation to determine where the touch _would have been_
//  had we recorded a touch at exactly 0.07 seconds ago. From there on, we use 
//
//  This code is coordinate system agnostic. I've chosen constants that made sense for 
//  a coordinate system where the viewport is 1.0 by 1.0 in size. However, when you
//  initialize this code, it will scale the constants as appropriate for your viewport size.
//  (For example, it works fine if your viewport is 320 x 480 in size.)
//
//  This code expects that you already have an animation loop running. By default, the
//  expectation is that you will call animate: sixty times a second. If you want to
//  run at a different rate, be sure to initialize this class with your expected animation
//  rate. Again, the built-in constants will be scaled to match.
//
